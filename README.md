# Matrix Multiplication Project: Sequential vs Parallel

## Description
In this project, we implement matrix multiplication using several approaches: sequential, parallel with threads, and parallel with processes.

## Functionalities

1. **Auxiliary**: Program to generate random matrices. It takes four command line arguments (n1, m1, n2, m2), which represent the dimensions of two matrices that will be multiplied. 

2. **Sequential**: Program that performs matrix multiplication sequentially. It receives as input two files containing the matrices M1 and M2 and performs the multiplication, saving the result and the execution time in a file.

3. **Parallel - Threads**: Program that multiply matrices using threads. Receives the input files and an integer P, indicating how many elements will be processed by a thread.

4. **Parallel - Processes**: Similar to threads program, but using processes instead of threads to multiply the matrices.
